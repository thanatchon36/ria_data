To minimise legal and reputational risk associated with e-banking activities conducted both
domestically and cross-border, banks should ensure that adequate information is provided
on their websites to allow customers to make informed conclusions about the identity and
regulatory status of the bank before they enter into e-banking transactions.
Examples of such information that a bank could provide on its own website include:

The name of the bank and the location of its head office (and local offices if

The identity of the primary bank supervisory authority(ies) responsible for the

Principle 12: Banks should take appropriate measures to ensure adherence to
customer privacy requirements applicable to the jurisdictions to which the bank is
providing e-banking products and services.

How customers can contact the bank's customer service centre regarding service
problems, complaints, suspected misuse of accounts, etc.
Maintaining a customer's information privacy is a key responsibility for a bank. Misuse or
unauthorised disclosure of confidential customer data exposes a bank to both legal and
reputation risk. To meet these challenges concerning the preservation of privacy of customer
information, banks should make reasonable endeavours to ensure that:
How customers can access and use applicable Ombudsman or consumer complaint
schemes.
How customers can obtain access to information on applicable national
compensation or deposit insurance coverage and the level of protection that they
afford (or links to websites that provide such information).
Other information that may be appropriate or required by specific jurisdictions.30
The bank's customer privacy policies and standards take account of and comply
with all privacy regulations and laws applicable to the jurisdictions to which it is
providing e-banking products and services.
Customers are made aware of the bank's privacy policies and relevant privacy
issues concerning use of e-banking products and services.
Customers may decline ("opt out") from permitting the bank to share with a third
party for cross-marketing purposes any information about the customer's personal
needs, interests, financial position or banking activity.
Customer data are not used for purposes beyond which they are specifically allowed
or for purposes beyond which customers have authorised.³1
