Together, these factors underscore the need for a comprehensive and ongoing evaluation of
outsourcing relationships and other external dependencies, including the associated
implications for the bank's risk profile and risk management oversight abilities.¹5 Board and
senior management oversight of outsourcing relationships and third-party dependencies
should specifically focus on ensuring that:

Security Controls (Principles 4 to 10)
While the Board of Directors has the responsibility for ensuring that appropriate security
control processes are in place for e-banking, the substance of these processes needs
special management attention because of the enhanced security challenges posed by ebanking. The following issues are particularly pertinent:
16
The bank fully understands the risks associated with entering into an outsourcing or
partnership arrangement for its e-banking systems or applications.
17
An appropriate due diligence review of the competency and financial viability of any
third-party service provider or partner is conducted prior to entering into any contract
for e-banking services.

16
The contractual accountability of all parties to the outsourcing ¹6 or partnership
relationship is clearly defined. For instance, responsibilities for providing information
to and receiving information from the service provider should be clearly defined.
All outsourced e-banking systems and operations are subject to risk management,
security and privacy policies that meet the bank's own standards.
Periodic independent internal and/or external audits are conducted of outsourced
operations to at least the same scope required if such operations were conducted
in-house.

Such an evaluation should also take into account the degree of control exercised on the third-party. A major
shareholder in a joint venture may, in many cases, exercise more control than in the case of a contractual
relationship with a service provider. However, it should not be inferred through such distinctions that
shareholder control over a joint venture or a partnership will necessarily be sufficient, especially if the
technologies and services necessary to operate the association are provided by the minority shareholder.
Such distinctions are mainly useful to assert that evaluations should be made on a case-by-case basis.
This would also include sub-contractors.
