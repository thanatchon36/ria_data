and external attacks, that may hamper the provision of e-banking systems and
services.
Effective incident response mechanisms are critical to minimise operational, legal and
reputational risks arising from unexpected events such as internal and external attacks that
may affect the provision of e-banking systems and services. Banks should develop
appropriate incident response plans, including communication strategies, that ensure
business continuity, control reputation risk and limit liability associated with disruptions in
their e-banking services, including those originating from outsourced systems and
operations.

Incident response plans to address recovery of e-banking systems and services
under various scenarios, businesses and geographic locations. Scenario analysis
should include consideration of the likelihood of the risk occurring and its impact on
the bank. E-banking systems that are outsourced to third-party service providers
should be an integral part of these plans
Mechanisms to identify an incident or crisis as soon as it occurs, assess its

A communication strategy to adequately address external market and media
concerns that may arise in the event of security breaches, online attacks and/or
failures of e-banking systems.
A clear process for alerting the appropriate regulatory authorities in the event of
material security breaches or disruptive incidents occur.
Incident response teams with the authority to act in an emergency and sufficiently
aine analysing incident detection/response systems and interpreting the
significance of related output.
A clear chain of command, encompassing both internal as well as outsourced
operations, to ensure that prompt action is taken appropriate for the significance of
the incident. In addition, escalation and internal communication procedures should
be developed and include notification of the Board where appropriate.
A process to ensure all relevant external parties, including bank customers,
counterparties and the media, are informed in a timely and appropriate manner of
material e-banking disruptions and business resumption developments.
A process for collecting and preserving forensic evidence to facilitate appropriate
