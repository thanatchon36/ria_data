Security Controls (Principles 4 to 10):
Authentication of e-banking customers.
Non-repudiation and accountability for e-banking transactions.
Appropriate measures to ensure segregation of duties.
Proper authorisation controls within e-banking systems, databases and applications.
Data integrity of e-banking transactions, records, and information.
Establishment of clear audit trails for e-banking transactions.
Confidentiality of key bank information.
Legal and Reputational Risk Management (Principles 11 to 14):
Appropriate disclosures for e-banking services.
Privacy of customer information.
Capacity, business continuity and contingency planning to ensure availability of ebanking systems and services.
Incident response planning.
Each of the above issues is discussed more specifically in the following sections, as they
relate to e-banking and the underlying risk management principles that should be considered
by banks to address these issues. Where appropriate, sound practices that may be
considered as effective ways to address these risks are also offered in a referenced
appendix.
A.
Board and Management Oversight (Principles 1 to 3)
The Board of Directors and senior management are responsible for developing the banking
institution's business strategy. An explicit strategic decision should be made as to whether
the Board wishes the bank to provide e-banking transactional services before beginning to
offer such services. Specifically, the Board should ensure that e-banking plans are clearly
integrated within corporate strategic goals, a risk analysis is performed of the proposed ebanking activities, appropriate risk mitigation and monitoring processes are established for
identified risks, and ongoing reviews are conducted to evaluate the results of e-banking
activities against the institution's business plans and objectives.

In addition, the Board and senior management should ensure that the operational and
security risk dimensions of the institution's e-banking business strategies are appropriately
considered and addressed. The provision of financial services over the Internet may
significantly modify and/or even increase traditional banking risks (e.g. strategic, reputational,
operational, credit and liquidity risk). Steps should therefore be taken to ensure that the
bank's existing risk management processes, security control processes, due diligence and
oversight processes for outsourcing relationships are appropriately evaluated and modified to
accommodate e-banking services.
