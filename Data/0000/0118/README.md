Bank management should clearly identify the strategic purposes, benefits
and costs associated with entering into outsourcing arrangements for ebanking with third parties.
The decision to outsource a key e-banking function or service should be
consistent with the bank's business strategies, be based on a clearly
defined business need, and recognise the specific risks that outsourcing
entails.
All affected areas of the bank need to understand how the service
provider(s) will support the bank's e-banking strategy and fit into its
operating structure.
Banks should consider developing processes for soliciting proposals from
several e-banking service providers and criteria for choosing among the
various proposals.
Once a potential service provider has been identified, the bank should
conduct an appropriate due diligence review, including a risk analysis of the
service provider's financial strength, reputation, risk management policies
and controls, and ability to fulfil its obligations.
Thereafter, banks should regularly monitor and, as appropriate, ³6 conduct
due diligence reviews of the ability of the service provider to fulfil its service
and associated risk management obligations throughout the duration of the
contract.
Banks need to ensure that adequate resources are committed to
overseeing outsourcing arrangements supporting e-banking.
Responsibilities for overseeing e-banking outsourcing arrangements should
be clearly assigned.
