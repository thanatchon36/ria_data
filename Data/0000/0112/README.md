The inherent nature of straight-through processes for e-banking may make programming
errors or fraudulent activities more difficult to detect at an early stage. Therefore, it is
important that banks implement straight-through processing in a manner that ensures safety
and soundness and data integrity.
As e-banking is transacted over public networks, transactions are exposed to the added
threat of data corruption, fraud and the tampering of records. Accordingly, banks should
ensure that appropriate measures are in place to ascertain the accuracy, completeness and
reliability of e-banking transactions, records and information that is either transmitted over
the Internet, resident on internal bank databases, or transmitted/stored by third-party service
providers on behalf of the bank.29 Common practices used to maintain data integrity within an
e-banking environment include the following:

E-banking transactions should be conducted in a manner that makes them highly
resistant to tampering throughout the entire process.
E-banking records should be stored, accessed and modified in a manner that makes
them highly resistant to tampering.

E-banking transaction and record-keeping processes should be designed in a
manner as to make it virtually impossible to circumvent detection of unauthorised
changes.

Adequate change control policies, including monitoring and testing procedures,
should be in place to protect against any e-banking system changes that may
erroneously or unintentionally compromise controls or data reliability.
Principle 9: Banks should ensure that clear audit trails exist for all e-banking
transactions.
Any tampering with e-banking transactions or records should be detected by
transaction processing, monitoring and record keeping functions.
Delivery of financial services over the Internet can make it more difficult for banks to apply
and enforce internal controls and maintain clear audit trails if these measures are not
adapted to an e-banking environment. Banks are not only challenged to ensure that effective
internal control can be provided in highly automated environments, but also that the controls
can be independently audited, particularly for all critical e-banking events and applications.
A bank's internal control environment may be weakened if it is unable to maintain clear audit
trails for its e-banking activities. This is because much, if not all, of its records and evidence
supporting e-banking transactions are in an electronic format. In making a determination as
to where clear audit trails should be maintained, the following types of e-banking transactions
should be considered:
The opening, modification or closing of a customer's account.
