technology evolves. Further, as the industry continues to address e-banking technical issues,
including security challenges, a variety of innovative and cost efficient risk management
solutions are likely to emerge. These solutions are also likely to address issues related to the
fact that banks differ in size, complexity and risk management culture and that jurisdictions
differ in their legal and regulatory frameworks.
For these reasons, the Committee does not believe that a "one size fits all" approach to ebanking risk management is appropriate, and it encourages the exchange of good practices
and standards to address the additional risk dimensions posed by the e-banking delivery
channel. In keeping with this supervisory philosophy, the risk management principles and
sound practices identified in this Report are expected to be used as tools by national
supervisors and implemented with adaptations to reflect specific national requirements where
necessary, to help promote safe and secure e-banking activities and operations.
The Committee recognises that each bank's risk profile is different and requires a risk
mitigation approach appropriate for the scale of the e-banking operations, the materiality of
the risks present, and the willingness and ability of the institution to manage these risks.
These differences imply that the risk management principles presented in this Report are
intended to be flexible enough to be implemented by all relevant institutions across
jurisdictions. National supervisors will assess the materiality of the risks related to e-banking
activities present at a given bank and whether, and to what extent, the risk management
principles for e-banking have been adequately met by the bank's risk management
framework.
II.
Risk Management Principles for Electronic Banking
The e-banking risk management principles identified in this Report fall into three broad, and
often overlapping, categories of issues. However, these principles are not weighted by order
of preference or importance. If only because such weighting might change over time, it is
preferable to remain neutral and avoid such prioritisation.

Board and Management Oversight (Principles 1 to 3):
Effective management oversight of e-banking activities.
Establishment of a comprehensive security control process.
Comprehensive due diligence and management oversight process for outsourcing
relationships and other third-party dependencies.
This Report refers to a management structure composed of a board of directors and senior management. The
Committee is aware that there are significant differences in legislative and regulatory frameworks across
countries as regards the functions of the board of directors and senior management. In some countries, the
board has the main, if not exclusive, function of supervising the executive body (senior management, general
management) so as to ensure that the latter fulfils its duties. For this reason it is sometimes known as the
supervisory board. In such cases, the board has no executive powers. By contrast, in other countries, the
board has a broader competence including the definition of the bank's general management framework.
Because of these differences, the terms "board of directors" and "senior management" are used in the report
to identify two decision-making functions within a bank but not to identify legal constructs.
