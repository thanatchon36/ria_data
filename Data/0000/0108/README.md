Principle 4: Banks should take appropriate measures to authenticate¹8 the identity and
authorisation of customers with whom it conducts business over the Internet.
Segregation of duties
It is essential in banking to confirm that a particular communication, transaction, or access
request is legitimate. Accordingly, banks should use reliable methods for verifying the identity
and authorisation of new customers as well as authenticating the identity and authorisation of
established customers seeking to initiate electronic transactions.
Authorisation controls
Customer verification during account origination is important in reducing the risk of identity
theft, fraudulent account applications and money laundering. Failure on the part of the bank
to adequately authenticate customers could result in unauthorised individuals gaining access
to e-banking accounts and ultimately financial loss and reputational damage to the bank
through fraud, disclosure of confidential information or inadvertent involvement in criminal
activity.

Establishing and authenticating an individual's identity and authorisation to access banking
systems in a purely electronic open network environment can be a difficult task. Legitimate
user authorisation can be misrepresented through a variety of techniques generally known as
"spoofing." Online hackers can also take over the session of a legitimate authorised
individual through use of a "sniffer"20 and carry out activities of a mischievous or criminal
nature. Authentication control processes can in addition be circumvented through the
alteration of authentication databases.

Accordingly, it is critical that banks have formal policy and procedures identifying appropriate
methodology(ies) to ensure that the bank properly authenticates the identity and
authorisation of an individual, agent or system²¹ by means that are unique and, as far as
practical, exclude unauthorised individuals or systems.² Banks can us a variety of methods
to establish authentication, including PINs, passwords, smart cards, biometrics, and digital

Authentication as used in this Report refers to the techniques, procedures and processes used to verify the
identity and authorisation of prospective and established customers. Identification refers to the procedures,
techniques and processes used to establish the identity of a customer when opening an account.
Authorisation refers to the procedures, techniques and processes used to determine that a customer or an
employee has legitimate access to the bank account or the authority to conduct associated transactions on
that account.

A sniffer is a device that is capable of eavesdropping on telecommunications traffic, capturing passwords and
data in transit.
Spoofing is impersonating a legitimate customer through use of his/her account number, password, personal
identification number (PIN) and/or email address.
Systems include the institution's own web sites.
Systems must ensure that they are dealing with an authenticated individual, agent or system and with a valid
authentication database.
