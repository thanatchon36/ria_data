Principle 1: The Board of Directors and senior management should establish effective
management oversight over the risks associated with e-banking activities, including
the establishment of specific accountability, policies and controls to manage these
risks.
Vigilant management oversight is essential for the provision of effective internal controls over
e-banking activities. In addition to the specific characteristics of the Internet distribution
channel discussed in the Introduction, the following aspects of e-banking may pose
considerable challenge to traditional risk management processes:

Major elements of the delivery channel (the Internet and related technologies) are
outside of the bank's direct control.
The Internet facilitates delivery of services across multiple national jurisdictions,
including those not currently served by the institution through physical locations.
In light of the unique characteristics of e-banking, new e-banking projects that may have a
significant impact on the bank's risk profile and strategy should be reviewed by the Board of
Directors and senior management and undergo appropriate strategic and cost/reward
analysis. Without adequate up-front strategic review and ongoing performance to plan
assessments, banks are at risk of underestimating the cost and/or overestimating the
payback of their e-banking initiatives.

The complexity of issues that are associated with e-banking and that involve highly
technical language and concepts are in many cases outside the traditional
experience of the Board and senior management.
In addition, the Board and senior management should ensure that the bank does not enter
into new e-banking businesses or adopt new technologies unless it has the necessary
expertise to provide competent risk management oversight. Management and staff expertise
should be commensurate with the technical nature and complexity of the bank's e-banking
applications and underlying technologies. Adequate expertise is essential regardless of
whether the bank's e-banking systems and services are managed in-house or outsourced to
third parties. Senior management oversight processes should operate on a dynamic basis in
order to effectively intervene and correct any material e-banking systems problems or
security breaches that may occur. The increased reputational risk associated with e-banking
necessitates vigilant monitoring of systems operability and customer satisfaction as well as
appropriate incident reporting to the Board and senior management.

Finally, the Board and senior management should ensure that its risk management
processes for its e-banking activities are integrated into the bank's overall risk management
approach. The bank's existing risk management policies and processes should be evaluated
to ensure that they are robust enough to cover the new risks posed by current or planned ebanking activities. Additional risk management oversight steps that the Board and senior
management should consider taking include:
Clearly establishing the banking organisation's risk appetite in relation to e-banking.
Establishing key delegations and reporting mechanisms, including the necessary
escalation procedures for incidents that impact the bank's safety, soundness or
