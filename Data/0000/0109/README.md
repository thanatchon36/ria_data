certificates.23 These methods can be either single factor or multi-factor (e.g. using both a
password and biometric technology24 to authenticate). Multi-factor authentication generally
provides stronger assurance.
The bank must determine which authentication methods to use based on management's
assessment of the risk posed by the e-banking system as a whole or by the various subcomponents. This risk analysis should evaluate the transactional capabilities25 of the ebanking system (e.g. funds transfer, bill payment, loan origination, account aggregation etc.),
the sensitivity and value of the stored e-banking data, and the customer's ease using the
authentication method.
Robust customer identification and authentication processes are particularly important in the
cross-border e-banking context given the additional difficulties that may arise from doing
business electronically with customers across national borders, including the greater risk of
identity impersonation and the greater difficulty in conducting effective credit checks on
potential customers.
As authentication methods continue to evolve, banks are encouraged to monitor and adopt
industry sound practice in this area such as ensuring that:

Authentication databases that provide access to e-banking customer accounts or
sensitive systems are protected from tampering and corruption. Any such tampering
should be detectable and audit trails should be in place to document such attempts.
24
Any addition, deletion or change of an individual, agent or system to an
authentication database is duly authorised by an authenticated source.

Principle 5: Banks should use transaction authentication methods that promote nonrepudiation and establish accountability for e-banking transactions.
25
Appropriate measures are in place to control the e-banking system connection such
that unknown third parties cannot displace known customers.
Non-repudiation involves creating proof of the origin or delivery of electronic information to
protect the sender against false denial by the recipient that the data has been received, or to
Authenticated e-banking sessions remain secure throughout the full duration of the
session or in the event of a security lapse the session should require reauthentication.

A bank may issue digital certificates using public key infrastructure (PKI) to a customer in order to secure
communications with the bank. Digital certificates and PKI are discussed more fully in Principle 5.

Biometric technology is an automated view of physiological or behavioural characteristics used to identify
and/or authenticate a person. Common forms of biometric technology include facial scans, finger scans, iris
scans, retina scans, hand scans, signature scans, voice scans and keystroke dynamics. Biometric
identification systems provide very strong authentication, but may pose greater implementation complexities
than other identification/authentication methods.
