Appendix I contains a number of additional sound practices to help ensure e-banking
security.

Assignment of explicit management/staff responsibility for overseeing the
establishment and maintenance of corporate security policies.ยน1

Principle 3: The Board of Directors and senior management should establish a
comprehensive and ongoing due diligence and oversight process for managing the
bank's outsourcing relationships and other third-party dependencies supporting ebanking.

Sufficient physical controls to prevent unauthorised physical access to the
computing environment.
Increased reliance upon partners and third party service providers to perform critical ebanking functions lessens bank management's direct control. Accordingly, a comprehensive
process for managing the risks associated with outsourcing and other third-party
dependencies is necessary. This process should encompass the third-party activities of
partners and service providers, including the sub-contracting of outsourced activities that
may have a material impact on the bank.

Sufficient logical controls and monitoring processes" to prevent unauthorised
internal ยน3 and external access to e-banking applications and databases.
Historically, outsourcing was often limited to a single service provider for a given
functionality. However, in recent years, banks' outsourcing relationships have increased in
scale and complexity as a direct result of advances in information technology and the
emergence of e-banking. Adding to the complexity is the fact that outsourced e-banking
services can be sub-contracted to additional service providers and/or conducted in a foreign
country. Further, as e-banking applications and services have become more technologically
advanced and have grown in strategic importance, certain e-banking functional areas are
dependent upon a small number of specialised third-party vendors and service providers.
These developments may lead to increased risk concentrations that warrant attention both
from an individual bank as well as a systemic industry standpoint.
A
Regular review and testing of security measures and controls, including the
continuous tracking of current industry security developments and installation of
appropriate software upgrades, service packs and other required measures.

This responsibility should normally not be part of the audit function, which has responsibility for seeing that the
security oversight function is carried out effectively.
Including controlled access rights and privileges as well as ongoing monitoring of network intrusion attempts.
Including employees, contractors and those with access rights through outsourced relationships.
Including measures to monitor network activity, log intrusion attempts and report of serious security breaches.
