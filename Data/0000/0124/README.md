Appendix VI
Sound Capacity, Business Continuity and
Contingency Planning Practices for E-Banking
All e-banking services and applications, including those provided by third-party
service providers, should be identified and assessed for criticality.
A risk assessment for each critical e-banking service and application, including the
potential implications of any business disruption on the bank's credit, market,
liquidity, legal, operational and reputation risk should be conducted.
Performance criteria for each critical e-banking service and application should be
established, and service levels should be monitored against such criteria.
Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that e-banking systems can handle
high and low transaction volume and that systems performance and capacity is
consistent with the bank's expectations for future growth in e-banking.
Consideration should be given to developing processing alternatives for managing
demand when e-banking systems appear to be reaching defined capacity
checkpoints.
E-banking business continuity plans should be formulated to address any reliance
on third-party service providers and any other external dependencies required
achieving recovery.
E-banking contingency plans should set out a process for restoring or replacing ebanking processing capabilities, reconstructing supporting transaction information,
and include measures to be taken to resume availability of critical e-banking
systems and applications in the event of a business disruption.
