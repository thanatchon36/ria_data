To minimise legal and reputational risk associated with e-banking activities conducted both
domestically and cross-border, banks should make adequate disclosure of information on
their web sites and take appropriate measures to ensure adherence to customer privacy
requirements applicable in the jurisdictions to which the bank is providing e-banking services.
Legal and Reputational Risk Management
To protect banks against business, legal and reputation risk, e-banking services must be
delivered on a consistent and timely basis in accordance with high customer expectations for
constant and rapid availability and potentially high transaction demand. The bank must have
the ability to deliver e-banking services to all end-users and be able maintain such
availability in all circumstances. Effective incident response mechanisms are also critical to
minimise operational, legal and reputational risks arising from unexpected events, including
internal and external attacks, that may affect the provision of e-banking systems and
services. To meet customers' expectations, banks should therefore have effective capacity,
business continuity and contingency planning. Banks should also develop appropriate
incident response plans, including communication strategies, that ensure business continuity,
control reputation risk and limit liability associated with disruptions in their e-banking
services.
