Appendix IV identifies several sound practices to help ensure that a clear audit trail exists for
e-banking transactions.

Principle 10: Banks should take appropriate measures to preserve the confidentiality
of key e-banking information. Measures taken to preserve confidentiality should be
commensurate with the sensitivity of the information being transmitted and/or stored
in databases.
Confidentiality is the assurance that key information remains private to the bank and is not
viewed or used by those unauthorised to do so. Misuse or unauthorised disclosure of data
exposes a bank to both reputation and legal risk. The advent of e-banking presents
additional security challenges for banks because it increases the exposure that information
transmitted over the public network or stored in databases may be accessible by
unauthorised or inappropriate parties or used in ways the customer providing the information
did not intend. Additionally, increased use of service providers may expose key bank data to
other parties.
To meet these challenges concerning the preservation of confidentiality of key e-banking
information, banks need to ensure that:

All confidential bank data and records are only accessible by duly authorised and
authenticated individuals, agents or systems.
All confidential bank data are maintained in a secure manner and protected from
unauthorised viewing or modification during transmission over public, private or
internal networks.

The bank's standards and controls for data use and protection must be met when
third parties have access to the data through outsourcing relationships.
All access to restricted data is logged and appropriate efforts are made to ensure
that access logs are resistant to tampering.
C.
Legal and Reputational Risk Management (Principles 11 to 14)
Specific customer protection and privacy regulations and laws will vary from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. However, banks generally have a clear responsibility to provide their customers
with a level of comfort regarding information disclosures, protection of customer data and
business availability that approaches the level they would have if transacting business
through traditional banking distribution channels.
Principle 11: Banks should ensure that adequate information is provided on their
websites to allow potential customers to make an informed conclusion about the
bank's identity and regulatory status of the bank prior to entering into e-banking
transactions.
