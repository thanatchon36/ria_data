Introduction
Banking organisations have been delivering electronic services to consumers and
businesses remotely for years. Electronic funds transfer, including small payments and
corporate cash management systems, as well as publicly accessible automated machines for
currency withdrawal and retail account management, are global fixtures. However, the
increased world-wide acceptance of the Internet¹ as a delivery channel for banking products
and services provides new business opportunities for banks as well as service benefits for
their customers.
Continuing technological innovation and competition among existing banking organisations
and new market entrants has allowed for a much wider array of electronic banking² products
and services for retail and wholesale banking customers. These include traditional activities
such as accessing financial information, obtaining loans and opening deposit accounts, as
well as relatively new products and services such as electronic bill payment services,
personalised financial "portals," account aggregation and business-to-business market
places and exchanges.
Notwithstanding the significant benefits of technological innovation, the rapid development of
e-banking capabilities carries risks as well as benefits and it is important that these risks are
recognised and managed by banking institutions in a prudent manner. These developments
led the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to conduct a preliminary study of the risk
management implications of e-banking and e-money in 1998.5 This early study demonstrated
a clear need for more work in the area of e-banking risk management and that mission was
entrusted to a working group comprised of bank supervisors and central banks, the
Electronic Banking Group (EBG), which was formed in November 1999.

For the purposes of this Report, the Internet is defined to include all related web enabling technologies and
open telecommunications networks ranging from direct dial-up connections, the public World Wide Web, and
virtual private networks.
For the purpose of this Report, electronic banking, or e-banking, includes the provision of retail and small
value banking products and services through electronic channels as well as large value electronic payments
and other wholesale banking services delivered electronically.
Account aggregation services allow customers to obtain consolidated information about their financial and
non-financial accounts in one place. An aggregator essentially acts as agent for customers to provide
consolidated information on customers' accounts across several financial institutions. Customers provide the
aggregator with the necessary security password or personal identification number to access and consolidate
account information primarily through screen scraping, a process that involves culling data from the other
institutions' websites, often without their knowledge, or through contractually arranged direct data feeds
between financial institutions.
Because of rapid changes in information technology, no description of such of risks can be exhaustive.
However, the risks facing banks engaged in e-banking are generally not new and they are encompassed by
risk categories identified in the Basel Committee's Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision,
September 1997. That guidance identified eight risk categories including credit risk, country and transfer risk,
market risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal risk and reputational risk. The Core Principles
are available on the BIS website at http://www.bis.org.
