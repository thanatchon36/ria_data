Appendix V identifies several sound practices to help maintain the privacy of customer ebanking information.
Principle 13: Banks should have effective capacity, business continuity and
contingency planning processes to help ensure the availability of e-banking systems
and services.
To protect banks against business, legal and reputation risk, e-banking services must be
delivered on a consistent and timely basis in accordance with customer expectations. To
achieve this, the bank must have the ability to deliver e-banking services to end-users from
either primary (e.g. internal bank systems and applications) or secondary sources (e.g.
systems and applications of service providers). The maintenance of adequate availability is
also dependent upon the ability of contingency back-up systems to mitigate denial of service
attacks or other events that may potentially cause business disruption.
The bank's standards for customer data use must be met when third parties have
access to customer data through outsourcing relationships.
The challenge to maintain continued availability of e-banking systems and applications can
be considerable given the potential for high transaction demand, especially during peak time
periods. In addition, high customer expectations regarding short transaction processing cycle
times and constant availability (24 X 7) has also increased the importance of sound capacity,
business continuity and contingency planning. To provide customers with the continuity of ebanking services that they expect, banks need to ensure that:

E-banking transaction processing capacity estimates are established, stress tested
and periodically reviewed.

Appropriate business continuity and contingency plans for critical e-banking
processing and delivery systems are in place and regularly tested.

contain and minimise problems arising from unexpected events, including internal

In some jurisdictions, laws and regulations may not oblige banks to seek the customer's permission to use
customer data for internal purposes. However, they may oblige banks to give the customer the option to
decline from permitting the bank to share such information with a third party or an affiliate. In other
jurisdictions, customers may have the right to prevent the bank from using their data for either internal or
external purposes.
