applications. Therefore, the controls traditionally required to maintain segregation of duties
need to be reviewed and adapted to ensure an appropriate level of control is maintained.
Because access to poorly secured databases can be more easily gained through internal or
external networks, strict authorisation and identification procedures, safe and sound
architecture of the straight-through processes, and adequate audit trails should be
emphasised.
Common practices used to establish and maintain segregation of duties within an e-banking
environment include the following:

Transaction processes and systems should be designed to ensure that no single
employee/outsourced service provider could enter, authorise and complete a
transaction.
Segregation should be maintained between those initiating static data (including
web page content) and those responsible for verifying its integrity.
E-banking systems should be tested to ensure that segregation of duties cannot be
bypassed.
Principle 7: Banks should ensure that proper authorisation controls and access
privileges are in place for e-banking systems, databases and applications.
Segregation should be maintained between those developing and those
administrating e-banking systems.²

In order to maintain segregation of duties, banks need to strictly control authorisation and
access privileges. Failure to provide adequate authorisation control could allow individuals to
alter their authority, circumvent segregation and ain access to e-banking systems,
databases or applications to which they are not privileged.
28
In e-banking systems, the authorisations and access rights can be established in either a
centralised or distributed manner within a bank and are generally stored in databases. The
protection of those databases from tampering or corruption is therefore essential for effective
authorisation control.

Appendix III identifies a number of sound practices to help establish proper control over
authorisation and access rights to e-banking systems, databases and applications.
Principle 8: Banks should ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect the
data integrity of e-banking transactions, records and information.
Data integrity refers to the assurance that information that is in-transit or in storage is not
altered without authorisation. Failure to maintain the data integrity of transactions, records
and information can expose banks to financial losses as well as to substantial legal and
reputational risk.
Or alternate mitigating controls should be in place.
