The Basel Committee released the EBG's Report on risk management and supervisory
issues arising from e-banking developments in October 2000. This Report inventoried and
assessed the major risks associated with e-banking, namely strategic risk, reputational risk,
operational risk (including security and legal risks), and credit, market, and liquidity risks.
The EBG concluded that e-banking activities did not raise risks that were not already
identified by the previous work of the Basel Committee. However, it noted that e-banking
increase and modifies some of these traditional risks, thereby influencing the overall risk
profile of banking. In particular, strategic risk, operational risk, and reputational risk are
certainly heightened by the rapid introduction and underlying technological complexity of ebanking activities.

Risk management challenges
The EBG noted that the fundamental characteristics of e-banking (and e-commerce more
generally) posed a number of risk management challenges:

The speed of change relating to technological and customer service innovation in ebanking is unprecedented. Historically, new banking applications were implemented
over relatively long periods of time and only after in-depth testing. Today, however,
banks are experiencing competitive pressure to roll out new business applications in
very compressed time frames - often only a few months from concept to production.
This competition intensifies the management challenge to ensure that adequate
strategic assessment, risk analysis and security reviews are conducted prior to
implementing new e-banking applications.
Transactional e-banking web sites and associated retail and wholesale business
applications are typically integrated as much as possible with legacy computer
systems to allow more straight-through processing of electronic transactions. Such
straight-through automated processing reduces opportunities for human error and
fraud inherent in manual processes, but it also increases dependence on sound
systems design and architecture as well as system interoperability and operational
scalability.
E-banking increases banks' dependence on information technology, thereby
increasing the technical complexity of many operational and security issues and
furthering a trend towards more partnerships, alliances and outsourcing
arrangements with third parties, many of whom are unregulated. This development
has been leading to the creation of new business models involving banks and nonbank entities, such as Internet service providers, telecommunication companies and
other technology firms.
The Internet is ubiquitous and global by nature. It is an open network accessible
from anywhere in the world by unknown parties, with routing of messages through
unknown locations and via fast evolving wireless devices. Therefore, it significantly

This Report uses the Basel Committee's definition of operational risk, which includes security risk and legal
risk (see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, The New Basel Capital Accord, April 2003, paragraph
607: "risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external
events").
