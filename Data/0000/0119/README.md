The contractual liabilities of the respective parties as well as responsibilities
for making decisions, including any sub-contracting of material services are
clearly defined.
Responsibilities for providing information to and receiving information from
the service provider are clearly defined. Information from the service
provider should be timely and comprehensive enough to allow the bank to
adequately assess service levels and risks. Materiality thresholds and
procedures to be used to notify the bank of service disruptions, security
breaches and other events that pose a material risk to the bank should be
spelled out.
Provisions that specifically address insurance coverage, the ownership of
the data stored on the service provider's servers or databases, and the right
of the bank to recover its data upon expiration or termination of the contract
should be clearly defined.
Performance expectations, under both normal and contingency
circumstances, are defined.
Adequate means and guarantees, for instance through audit clauses, are
defined to insure that the service provider complies with the bank's policies.
Provisions are in place for timely and orderly intervention and rectification in
the event of substandard performance by the service provider.
For cross-border outsourcing arrangements, determining which country
laws and regulations, including those relating to privacy and other customer
protections, are applicable.
The right of the bank to conduct independent reviews and/or audits of
security, internal controls and business continuity and contingency plans is
explicitly defined.

terms and conditions in contracts governing e-banking outsourcing arrangements.
Banks should ensure that periodic independent internal and/or external audits are
conducted of outsourced operations to at least the same scope required if such
operations were conducted in-house.38
