reputation (e.g. networks penetration, employee security infractions and any serious
misuse of computer facilities).⁹
The Internet greatly facilitates a bank's ability to distribute products and services over
virtually unlimited geographic territory, including across national borders. Such cross-border
e-banking activity, particularly if conducted without any existing licensed physical presence in
the "host country," potentially subjects banks to increased legal, regulatory and country risk
due to the substantial differences that may exist between jurisdictions with respect to bank
licensing, supervision and customer protection requirements. Because of the need to avoid
inadvertent non-compliance with a foreign country's laws or regulations, as well as to
manage relevant country risk factors, banks contemplating cross-border e-banking
operations need to fully explore these risks before undertaking such operations and
effectively manage them.

Addressing any unique risk factors associated with ensuring the security, integrity
and availability of e-banking products and services, and requiring that third parties to
whom the banks has outsourced key systems or applications take similar measures.
Depending on the scope and complexity of e-banking activities, the scope and structure of
risk management programs will vary across banking organisations. Resources required to
oversee e-banking services should be commensurate with the transactional functionality and
criticality of systems, the vulnerability of networks and the sensitivity of information being
transmitted.
Ensuring that appropriate due diligence and risk analysis are performed before the
bank conducts cross-border e-banking activities.
Principle 2: The Board of Directors and senior management should review and
approve the key aspects of the bank's secu control process.
The Board of Directors and senior management should oversee the development and
continued maintenance of a security control infrastructure that properly safeguards e-banking
systems and data from both internal and external threats. This should include establishing
appropriate authorisation privileges, logical and physical access controls, and adequate
infrastructure security to maintain appropriate boundaries and restrictions on both internal
and external user activities.

Safeguarding of bank assets is one of the Board's fiduciary duties and one of senior
management's fundamental responsibilities. However, it is a challenging task in a rapidly
evolving e-banking environment because of the complex security risks associated with
operating over the public Internet network and using innovative technology.
10
To ensure proper security controls for e-banking activities, the Board and senior
management need to ascertain whether the bank has a comprehensive security process,
including policies and procedures, that addresses potential internal and external security

In addition to internal reporting requirements, incident reporting escalation procedures should also set forth the
necessary reporting to appropriate supervisory authorities.
