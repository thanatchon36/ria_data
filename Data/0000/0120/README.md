Banks should develop appropriate contingency plans for outsourced e-banking
activities.

For outsourced relationships involving critical or technologically complex ebanking services/applications, banks may need to arrange for other
periodic reviews to be performed by independent third parties with sufficient
technical expertise.

Banks need to develop and periodically test their contingency plans for all
critical e-banking systems and services that have been outsourced to third
parties.
Contingency plans should address credible worst-case scenarios for
providing continuity of e-banking services in the event of a disruption
affecting outsourced operations.
Banks should have an identified team that is responsible for managing
recovery and assessing the financial impact of a disruption in outsourced ebanking services.
Banks that provide e-banking services to third parties should ensure that their
operations, responsibilities, and liabilities are sufficiently clear so that serviced
institutions can adequately carry out their own effective due diligence reviews and
ongoing oversight of the relationship.
Banks have a responsibility to provide serviced institutions with information
necessary to identify, control and monitor any risks associated with the ebanking service arrangement.
