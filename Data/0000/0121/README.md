Appendix III
Sound Authorisation Practices for E-Banking Applications
Specific authorisation and access privileges should be assigned to all individuals,
agents or systems, which conduct e-banking activities.
All e-banking systems should be constructed to ensure that they interact with a valid
authorisation database.
No individual agent or system should have the authority to change his or her own
authority or access privileges in an e-banking authorisation database.Â³
39
Any addition of an individual, agent or system or changes to access privileges in an
e-banking authorisation database should be duly authorised by an authenticated
source empowered with the adequate authority and subject to suitable and timely
oversight and audit trails.
Appropriate measures should be in place in order to make e-banking authorisation
databases reasonably resistant to tampering. Any such tampering should be
detectable through ongoing monitoring processes. Sufficient audit trails should exist
to document any such tampering.
Any e-banking authorisation database that has been tampered with should not be
used until replaced with a validated database.
Controls should be in place to prevent changes to authorisation levels during ebanking transaction sessions and any attempts to alter authorisation should be
logged and brought to the attention of management.
