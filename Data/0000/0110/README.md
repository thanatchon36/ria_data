protect the recipient against false denial by the sender that the data has been sent. Risk of
transaction repudiation is already an issue with conventional transactions such as credit
cards or securities transactions. However, e-banking heightens this risk because of the
difficulties of positively authenticating the identities and authority of parties initiating
transactions, the potential for altering or hijacking electronic transactions, and the potential
for e-banking users to claim that transactions were fraudulently altered.
To address these heightened concerns, banks need to make reasonable efforts,
commensurate with the materiality and type of the e-banking transaction, to ensure that:

E-banking systems are designed to reduce the likelihood that authorised users will
initiate unintended transactions and that customers fully understand the risks
associated with any transactions they initiate.
All parties to the transaction are positively authenticated and control is maintained
over the authenticated channel.
Financial transaction data are protected from alteration and any alteration is
detectable.
Banking organisations have begun to employ various techniques that help establish nonrepudiation and ensure confidentiality and integrity of e-banking transactions, such as digital
certificates using public key infrastructure (PKI).27 A bank may issue a digital certificate to a
customer or counterparty to allow for their unique identification/authentication and reduce the
risk of transaction repudiation. Although in some countries customers' rights to disclaim
transactions is provided in specific legal provisions, legislation has been passed in certain
national jurisdictions making digital signatures legally enforceable. Wider global legal
acceptance of such techniques is likely as technology continues to evolve.
Principle 6: Banks should ensure that appropriate measures are in place to promote
adequate segregation of duties within e-banking systems, databases and applications.
Segregation of duties is a basic internal control measure designed to reduce the risk of fraud
in operational processes and systems and ensure that transactions and company assets are
properly authorised, recorded and safeguarded. Segregation of duties is critical to ensuring
the accuracy and integrity of data and is used to prevent the perpetration of fraud by an
individual. If duties are adequately separated, fraud can only be committed through collusion.
E-banking services may necessitate modifying the ways in which segregation of duties are
established and maintained because transactions take place over electronic systems where
identities can be more readily masked or faked. In addition, operational and transactionbased functions have in many cases become more compressed and integrated in e-banking

In a public key infrastructure (PKI), each party has a private/public key pair. The private key is secret so that
only one person should use it. All parties use the public key. The private key generates an electronic signature
on the document and the key pairs are designed so that a message encrypted with the private key can only be
read by using the other key. A bank may act as its own certification authority (CA) or rely on another trusted
third-party to associate a person or entity with the digital certificate. However, if a bank is to rely upon a thirdparty digital certificate to establish authenticity, it should confirm that the CA, when issuing the certificate, used
the same level of authentication that the bank would have used to authenticate the person. The primary
drawback of a PKI authentication system is that it is more complicated to implement.
