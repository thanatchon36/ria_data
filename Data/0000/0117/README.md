Security profiles should be created and maintained and specific authorisation
privileges assigned to all users of e-banking systems and applications, including all
customers, internal bank users and outsourced service providers. Logical access
controls should also be designed to support proper segregation of duties.34
Appendix I
E-banking data and systems should be classified according to their sensitivity and
importance and protected accordingly. Appropriate mechanisms, such as
encryption, access control and data recovery plans should be used to protect all
sensitive and high-risk e-banking systems, servers, databases and applications.
Sound Security Control Practices for E-Banking
Storage of sensitive or high-risk data on the organisation's desktop and laptop
systems should be minimised and properly protected by encryption, access control
and data recovery plans.
Sufficient physical controls should be in place to deter unauthorised access³5 to all
critical e-banking systems, servers, databases and applications.

Appropriate techniques should be employed to mitigate external threats to e-banking
systems, including the use of:

Intrusion detection software and other security assessment tools to
periodically probe networks, servers and firewalls for weaknesses and/or
violations of security policies and controls.
Penetration testing of internal and external networks.
A rigorous security review process should be applied to all employees and service
providers holding sensitive positions.
Virus-scanning software at all critical entry points (e.g. remote access
servers, e-mail proxy servers) and on each desktop system.
Definitions of security and quality standards and reliance on certification schemes can be institution specific or
standardised (i.e. within a national banking industry in order to enhance and foster the security level of ebanking activities). Banks can also choose to establish access rights in either a centralised or distributed
manner. For example, there may be a single authorisation authority responsible for assigning access rights to
specific identities, groups or roles within a bank, or there may be a number of authorisation authorities
established to address the varying needs within the different business lines.
