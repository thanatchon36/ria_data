solutions are to be addressed by institutions and standard setting bodies as technology
evolves. However, this Report contains appendices that list some examples current and
widespread risk mitigation practices in the e-banking area that are supportive of the Risk
Management Principles.
Consequently, the Risk Management Principles and sound practices identified in this Report
are expected to be used as tools by national supervisors and implemented with adaptations
to reflect specific national requirements and individual risk profiles where necessary. In some
areas, the Principles have been expressed by the Committee or by national supervisors in
previous bank supervisory guidance. However, some issues, such as the management of
outsourcing relationships, security controls and legal and reputational risk management,
warrant more detailed principles than those expressed to date due to the unique
characteristics and implications of the Internet distribution channel.
The Risk Management Principles fall into three broad, and often overlapping, categories of
issues that are grouped to provide clarity: Board and Management Oversight; Security
Controls; and Legal and Reputational Risk Management.
Board and Management Oversight
Because the Board of Directors and senior management are responsible for developing the
institution's business strategy and establishing an effective management oversight over risks,
they are expected to take an explicit, informed and documented strategic decision as to
whether and how the bank is to provide e-banking services. The initial decision should
include the specific accountabilities, policies and controls to address risks, including those
arising in a cross-border context. Effective management oversight is expected to encompass
the review and approval of the key aspects of the bank's security control process, such as
the development and maintenance of a security control infrastructure that properly
safeguards e-banking systems and data from both internal and external threats. It also
should include a comprehensive process for managing risks associated with increased
complexity of and increasing reliance on outsourcing relationships and third-party
dependencies to perform critical e-banking functions.
Security Controls
While the Board of Directors has the responsibility for ensuring that appropriate security
control processes are in place for e-banking, the substance of these processes needs
special management attention because of the enhanced security challenges posed by ebanking. This should include establishing appropriate authorisation privileges and
authentication measures, logical and physical access controls, adequate infrastructure
security to maintain appropriate boundaries and restrictions on both internal and external
user activities and data integrity of transactions, records and information. In addition, the
existence of clear audit trails for all e-banking transactions should be ensured and measures
to preserve confidentiality of key e-banking information should be appropriate with the
sensitivity of such information.
