Risk Management Principles for Electronic Banking
Executive Summary
Continuing technological innovation and competition among existing banking organisations
and new entrants have allowed for a much wider array of banking products and services to
become accessible and delivered to retail and wholesale customers through an electronic
distribution channel collectively referred to as e-banking. However, the rapid development of
e-banking capabilities carries risks as well as benefits.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision expects such risks to be recognised,
addressed and managed by banking institutions in a prudent manner according to the
fundamental characteristics and challenges of e-banking services. These characteristics
include the unprecedented speed of change related to technological and customer service
innovation, the ubiquitous and global nature of open electronic networks, the integration of ebanking applications with legacy computer systems and the increasing dependence of banks
on third parties that provide the necessary information technology. While not creating
inherently new risks, the Committee noted that these characteristics increased and modified
some of the traditional risks associated with banking activities, in particular strategic,
operational, legal and reputational risks, thereby influencing the overall risk profile of
banking.
Based on these conclusions, the Committee considers that while existing risk management
principles remain applicable to e-banking activities, such principles must be tailored, adapted
and, in some cases, expanded to address the specific risk management challenges created
by the characteristics of e-banking activities. To this end, the Committee believes that it is
incumbent upon the Boards of Directors and banks' senior management to take steps to
ensure that their institutions have reviewed and modified where necessary their existing risk
management policies and processes to cover their current or planned e-banking activities.
The Committee also believes that the integration of e-banking applications with legacy
systems implies an integrated risk management approach for all banking activities of a
banking institution.
To facilitate these developments, the Committee has identified fourteen Risk Management
Principles for Electronic Banking to help banking institutions expand their existing risk
oversight policies and processes to cover their e-banking activities.
These Risk Management Principles are not put forth as absolute requirements or even "best
practice." The Committee believes that setting detailed risk management requirements in the
area of e-banking might be counter-productive, if only because these would be likely to
become rapidly outdated because of the speed of change related to technological and
customer service innovation. The Committee has therefore preferred to express supervisory
expectations and guidance in the form of Risk Management Principles in order to promote
safety and soundness for e-banking activities, while preserving the necessary flexibility in
implementation that derives in part from the speed of change in this area. Further, the
Committee recognises that each bank's risk profile is different and requires a tailored risk
mitigation approach appropriate for the scale of the e-banking operations, the materiality of
the risks present, and the willingness and ability of the institution to manage these risks. This
implies that a "one size fits all" approach to e-banking risk management issues may not be
appropriate.
