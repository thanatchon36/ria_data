magnifies the importance of security controls, customer authentication techniques,
data protection, audit trail procedures, and customer privacy standards.
B. Risk management principles
Based on the early work of the EBG, the Committee concluded that, while traditional banking
risk management principles are applicable to e-banking activities, the complex characteristics
of the Internet delivery channel dictate that the application of these principles must be
tailored to fit many online banking activities and their attendant risk management challenges.
To this end, the Committee believes that it is incumbent upon the Boards of Directors and
banks' senior management to take steps to ensure that their institutions have reviewed and
modified where necessary their existing risk management policies and processes to cover
their current or planned e-banking activities. Further, as the Committee believes that banks
should adopt an integrated risk management approach for all banking activities, it is critical
that the risk management oversight afforded e-banking activities becomes an integral part of
the banking institution's overall risk management framework.
To facilitate these developments, the Committee asked the EBG to identify the key risk
management principles that would help banking institutions expand their existing risk
oversight policies and processes to cover their e-banking activities and, in turn, promote the
safe and sound electronic delivery of banking products and services.
These Risk Management Principles for Electronic Banking, which are identified in this
Report, are not put forth as absolute requirements or even "best practice" but rather as
guidance to promote safe and sound e-banking activities. The Committee believes that
setting detailed risk management requirements in the area of e-banking might be counterproductive, if only because these would be likely to become rapidly outdated by the speed of
change related to technological and product innovation. Therefore the principles included in
the present Report express supervisory expectations related to the overall objective of
banking supervision to ensure safety and soundness in the financial system rather than
stringent regulations.
The Committee is of the view that such supervisory expectations should be tailored and
adapted to the e-banking distribution channel but not be fundamentally different to those
applied to banking activities delivered through other distribution channels. Consequently, the
principles presented below are largely derived and adapted from supervisory principles that
have already been expressed by the Committee or national supervisors over a number of
years. In some areas, such as the management of outsourcing relationships, security
controls and legal and reputational risk management, the characteristics and implications of
the Internet distribution channel introduce a need for more detailed principles than those
expressed to date.
The Committee recognises that banks will need to develop risk management processes
appropriate for their individual risk profile, operational structure and corporate governance
culture, as well as in conformance with the specific risk management requirements and
policies set forth by the bank supervisors in their particular jurisdiction(s). Further, the
numerous e-banking risk management practices identified in this Report, while
representative of current industry sound practice, should not be considered to be all-inclusive
or definitive, since many security controls and other risk management techniques continue to
evolve rapidly to keep pace with new technologies and business applications.
